                    <p class="card-text">
                        Monero (XMR) is a decentralized privacy-enhanced cryptocurrency with complete fungibility
                        launched in 2014.
                        Everything inside the Monero blockchain ecosystem is obfuscated: transactions, balances,
                        amounts.
                        <br>
                        Monero has an unlimited supply with a constant mining reward. This ensures a very small
                        inflation rate that mathematically tends to zero.
                        <br>
                        Monero uses a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX. It is egalitarian and ASIC-resistant by
                        design and ensures a truly decentralized mining consensus.
                        <br>
                        Monero has the third largest developer community among all cryptocurrencies and regularly
                        applies privacy and usability updates.
                        <br>
                        Tacking Capital intends to integrate Monero wherever possible, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>as an investment held by the fund</li>
                        <li>as a means of paying for goods and services</li>
                        <li>as part of our management company payroll</li>
                        <li>as a means of accepting commitments into the fund</li>
                        <li>as a means of making investment into our portfolio companies</li>
                    </ul>
                    Investment by the Monero Adoption Fund is conditional on the investee adopting Monero or benefitting
                    the Monero ecosystem to some degree, primarily as a means of receiving payment for goods and
                    services or providing a means to buy and sell Monero using fiat currency.
                    <br>
                    By facilitating Monero adoption we hope to create stable, sustainable, transaction-driven demand for
                    the privacy-enhanced cryptocurrency and increase token value.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Monero is at time of writing a cryptocurrency barely making the top 30 by market capitalization.
                        This is despite the fact that it has an unambiguously clear use case and utility as an anonymous
                        and seamless means of transacting, the third largest developer community among all
                        cryptocurrencies and some of the highest rates of use as a transaction medium. Among
                        privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies it is by far the most widely accepted and dwarfs potential
                        competitors such as Zcash by number of transactions, scale of adoption and market
                        capitalization.
                        <br>
                        The reasons it trails behind other cryptocurrencies less widely used as a transaction medium in
                        terms of market cap are mainly:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Lack of listing on widely used centralized exchanges, especially in the United States
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Institutional investors’ fears of regulatory risk against privacy-enhanced
                            cryptocurrencies
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The lack of a central, representative body or team to market Monero as an investment option
                            and a community primarily focused on the technological framework for creating an efficient
                            and private transaction medium
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    By helping build a regulatorily resilient and open Monero ecosystem and facilitating, supporting and
                    publicizing Monero adoption, Tacking Capital intends to create the conditions for exponential
                    valuation growth driven by a healthy mix of transaction and investment valuation growth. Thanks to
                    its uniquely large developer community with a strong focus on privacy and scalability, Monero is
                    ideally positioned to scale to effectively any level in terms of valuation and number of
                    transactions.

                        Monero adjacent businesses refers to businesses whose main business lies in supporting the
                        Monero ecosystem or providing it with goods and services. Examples can include everything from
                        hardware used to mine Monero to point of sale software and hardware or legal, consulting and
                        accounting services for business transacting using Monero.

                        One example of this is CPU manufacturers that produce and hardware that utilizes ARM CPUs. The

                        public and practical concerns about Monero’s proof-of-work algorithm. Additionally, increased
                        Monero value could facilitate demand for CPUs that are used to mine Monero.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        With more business and social life moving online, an increasing proportion of the world’s
                        transactions are taking place digitally and more and more of our sensitive information is stored
                        online. This has improved understanding of the importance of digital anonymity and privacy, and
                        a greater awareness of the pervasiveness of digital surveillance.
                        <br><br>
                        This awareness has boosted demand for software and hardware solutions that can provide privacy
                        and anonymity on the web. Tacking Capital hopes to realize strong returns by investing in clear,
                        practical digital privacy solutions with a strong ideological basis in keeping software and
                        hardware open-source where sensible.
                        <br><br>
                        We also foresees significant cohesion effects with integrating Monero into decentralized,
                        privacy and encryption focused businesses, as maintaining online anonymity and security is
                        dependent on a broader, privacy-focused ecosystem, of which truly anonymous, decentralized
                        transactions are an essential part of.

                        Fintech and decentralized finance (DeFi) prospects represent not only one of the fastest growing
                        sectors we can direct investment towards, but also exciting ways to build on- and off-ramps for
                        transitioning between Monero and fiat currency, the lack of which is a crucial barrier to
                        overcome in achieving widespread Monero adoption.
                        <br><br>
                        Acquiring Monero and transferring it on-chain must become as seamless, simple and as easy as
                        possible through integration into fintech services such as neobanks. While these businesses may
                        not be privacy-oriented in and of themselves, they provide a variety of on and off-ramps that
                        peer to peer services can utilize to expand the private part of the Monero ecosystem.
                        <br><br>
                        Creating many and varied ways in which to procure Monero and exchange it into fiat money or
                        other cryptocurrencies can also help building resilience from regulatory threats and ensures
                        that Monero adoption has no single point of failure.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy has always been ideally suited to cryptocurrency transactions,
                        with most transactions presently using cash as a means of payment in-person and services such as
                        PayPal for digital transactions. The use of the latter can cause problems for participants,
                        especially when done at a large scale or involving large transactions. Likewise, the use of
                        physical currency is limited to in-person transactions.
                        <br><br>
                        The use of Monero can help participants in P2P digital markets avoid risks inherent to
                        centralized payment processors while allowing these marketplaces to potentially act as an escrow
                        service for on-chain Monero transactions.
                        <br><br>
                        The P2P economy is both established and growing rapidly by expanding into spaces traditionally
                        served by large, centralized institutions hesitant to adopt cryptocurrency payments. We
                        therefore see prospects in the P2P sector as being both high-growth, return generating
                        investments and excellent means to drive Monero adoption.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        Tacking Capital’s Monero Adoption Fund relies on two main drivers of returns. The first is the
                        increase in the valuation of equity held in firms invested in (we use the Fair Value method for
                        estimating internal rate of return of private equity investments). Here we rely primarily on our
                        knowledge of the target industry, Monero adoption driving attractiveness for certain customer
                        demographics and our top of the line advisors expertise for making industry leading picks.
                        <br><br>
                        The other main driver of returns is the market value of Monero assets held by the fund. This is
                        likely to increase substantially over time thanks to organically increasing demand for private
                        transactions, increased adoption accelerating transaction-driven Monero demand and
                        well-publicized adoption driving investment demand for Monero.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The past several years have seen important trends in society, the crypto industry, fintech and
                        privacy that necessitate a social and market need for Monero and ideal business conditions for
                        Tacking Capital’s investment thesis.
                        <br><br>
                        Demand for data privacy and online anonymity are at an all-time high with <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-privacy-software-market-105420" target="_blank">the global data privacy software market projected to grow from $2.36 billion
                            in 2022 to $25.85 billion by 2029</a>, at a CAGR of 40.8%.
                        <br><br>
                        Increasing global <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/" target="_blank">political instability</a> and financial and digital surveillance is creating
                        more and more demand for ways in which people could communicate and transact anonymously online.
                        Monero fulfils this role, bolstered and complemented by the technologies that Tacking Capital
                        invests in.
                        <br><br>
                        Soaring inflation following years of monetary policy mismanagement has further diminished <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/05/12/federal-reserve-trust-americans-coronavirus" target="_blank">already faltering</a> trust in the federal reserve and central bank issued
                        fiat currency. With rising interest rates potentially decimating stock and crypto markets,
                        investors will be looking for a safe haven from inflation and a growing number of fiat money
                        skeptical consumers will be looking for alternate means of storing value and transacting with.
                        Monero has the technological basis to serve as both and the culture around it naturally appeals
                        to those wary of fiat money and the central banks that mismanage it.
                        <br><br>
                        The <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/06/26/exiting-x86-apple-microsoft-embracing-arm-based-pc" target="_blank">end of x86 architecture</a> in CPUs will help further decentralize Monero
                        mining and make it more environmentally friendly and energy and power efficient. It will also
                        create massive opportunities for prospects engaged with superior ARM and Risc-V architecture
                        CPUs, which Tacking Capital is ideally positioned to take advantage of and ensure they are
                        integrated into a broader Monero ecosystem.
                        <br><br>
                        The main barrier to price growth and adoption of Monero has consistently been poor adoption at
                        centralized cryptocurrency exchanges and a subsequently underdeveloped commercial payment
                        ecosystem. Tacking Capital exists to profitably help build that ecosystem, bolstering companies
                        that are part of it and fulfilling rapidly growing market demand for digital privacy and
                        anonymity.

                        their payroll. To this end we are partnering with leading accounting and legal firms in select
                        jurisdictions to minimize bureaucratic, accounting and legal hurdles that often hinder monero

                        assets. On a technical level, this extends to both hardware and software solutions. We intend to

                        <u>Political engagement averse</u>
                        <br>
                        Most industries targeted by Tacking Capital’s investment thesis are regulatorily complex and, in
                        some cases, relatively novel. We believe in investing in businesses operating in the current
                        legal environment and focusing on growth and revenue generation and are averse to businesses
                        being formed in anticipation of uncertain legal changes or actively involved in government
                        relations to facilitate an as-of-yet non-existent legal framework in which to operate.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>Investment size should be proportional to Monero adoption scale</u>
                        <br>
                        Tacking Capital tends to favor participating in many early to mid stage funding rounds with
                        relatively small ticket sizes. This allows it to facilitate Monero adoption with a larger number
                        of businesses. Our ticket size is dependent on growth potential, the number of new Monero users
                        that might be created by the investment and the utility Monero adoption would create for the
                        prospects being invested in.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>Fundamentals before ideology</u>
                        <br>
                        At its core, Tacking Capital is a business project and a profit maximizing fund whose
                        purpose is to generate returns of its investors. While there is an ideological basis for the
                        investment thesis it adopts, the main concern with every investment must be the return it will
                        create for investors. To this end, Monero adoption is just as much in service of increasing its
                        value and by extension the value of Tacking Capital’s Monero holdings as it is about creating
                        utility for the investee.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>No bullshit</u>
                        <br>
                        Tacking Capital and its team commit to maintaining a no bullshit attitude towards investors,
                        partners, investees and in internal company culture. Being honest, transparent, direct and blunt
                        is a key element of our company culture and the culture of the Monero community. We strive to
                        maintain this as one of our highest values.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <u>Disruption is more than a buzzword</u>
                        <br>
                        Many financial institutions claim to pursue disruptive technologies and business models while
                        simultaneously dreading their social and political effects. At Tacking Capital we believe in
                        creative destruction and in investing in technologies and businesses that achieve exponential
                        growth through real disruption, which inevitably involves violating established conventions and
                        taking on vested interests and established business models and the technological status quo. The
                        success of a cryptocurrency such as Monero must consequently be measured not in its fiat market
                        cap, but by the degree to which it unseats the fractional reserve fiat banking and monetary
                        systems.
                        <br><br>
                        <u>Youth</u>
                        <br>
                        It takes young teams with fresh ideas and a will to disrupt to achieve truly disruptive business
                        models and implement truly disruptive technologies such as Monero. As such, Tacking Capital
                        wears the youth of its founders and advisors on its sleeve and prefers prospects with young or
                        youthful teams.
