            <blockquote>
                Tacking is a sailing maneuver by which a sailing vessel, whose desired course is into the wind,
                turns its bow toward and through the wind, allowing progress in the desired direction.
                No sailing vessel can move directly upwind, though that may be the desired direction, making this an
                essential maneuver of a sailing ship.
